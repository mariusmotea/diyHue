Hi guys. 

I want to know if it possible to run this staff with Razer Synapse for a lightningshow in my computercase. 
I get it to connect with the emulator and the Razer Synapse will find the bridge-emulator and the custom lightbulb. 
But the Lightbulb won't react to the Razer commands. Any ideas?

Best regards Sonic Hedgehog
